The Problem:
There are N colleges available, each numbered and ranked from 1 to N. Students have specific preferences for colleges they would like to attend. The admission process revolves around filling vacant seats in these colleges based on students' ranks. Once a seat is filled in a college, its admissions for the year are closed, and students who had chosen that college must look for alternatives.

Objective:
The task at hand is to determine which college Chef will be admitted to, considering that he is student ID 1. This involves analyzing the rankings of both the colleges and the students, as well as the availability of seats in each college. It's essential to navigate through the preferences and constraints to identify the best outcome for Chef's higher education.

Procedure:
Understand the number of colleges (N) and their rankings.
Gather information about M students, including their ranks and college preferences.
Process the information to find available seats in each college.
Determine the college where Chef, as student ID 1, will be admitted.
If Chef's most preferred college has vacant seats, he secures admission there.
If not, Chef moves to his second-best option and repeats the process.
Continue this process until Chef secures admission or exhausts his options.
